# PINNs-for-approximately-solving-PDEs-
This repository implements (PINNs) to solve PDEs, specifically focusing on the Heat Equation and Linear Elasticity Equations. Unlike traditional deep learning models that act as "black boxes," PINNs incorporate the underlying physical laws directly into the neural network's loss function.
